    H1: Combining all her loves

    Hannah Lawrance is a 20-something business owner, social media strategist and free spirit based in Perth, Western Australia.

    Not only business savvy but socially-conscious, when she’s not working she’s spending her spare time helping the not-for-profit Borderless Friendship WA Inc. raise funds for health education in Thailand.

    Being a WA girl, Hannah naturally loves the beach. To get her mind off of her hectic work schedule, she decided to learn how to surf.

    Hannah loved the feeling of accomplishment she felt when she caught her first wave, and how every worry seemed to disappear while she bobbed up and down in the water.

    Hannah’s love for surfing took her to one of her favourite places ¬¬– Bali. It was here she met local surf coaches who told her how financially unsustainable surf coaching was in Bali.
    This got her thinking…

    After a few visits Hannah realised aside from the beach offers she got on the beach, she couldn’t find a casual and affordable surf lesson she could do on the fly.

    Connect Co. was born.
    A collective combining all of Hannah’s loves – the beach, surfing, social enterprise and human connection.

    Get connected.
