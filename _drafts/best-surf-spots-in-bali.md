1. Pandawa<br>Pandawa Bwach is located at Kutuh village, Badung regency south of Bali. It offers crisp white sand and clear blue water, making it very popular for your average tourist. However, it offers a secret spot for the more intermediate and advanced surfers. Being a further out reef break, it's best to be surfed in wet season where the tide is high enough over the reef. Wet season is generally October-April, but the rain only really comes in November-January.

2. Double-Six<br>&nbsp;
