Surfing in warm conditions, such as Bali, is by far the most preferred option by most surfers! So clothing requirements are generally very minimal — but not too minimal (heh). The only surf clothing you really need are bathers/board shorts and a rashie if you prefer.

**Boardshorts**<br>“Boardies” help stop you getting rash on your inner thigh from the board and wax. They are generally worn in warm weather conditions over bathers and come in all different lengths, colours and materials. As you are spending a lot of time in the water, boardies are designed to be comfortable, without rubbing, and to be durable, without falling to pieces as salt water can cause material and stitching to deteriorate.

**Rash Vest**<br>Rash vests (AKA rashies if you're Aussie) are commonly worn in hot sunny conditions to protect against sunburn. But when surfing, body rash can occur on your chest and stomach from the rubbing of your body against the wax on the board. They can also provide protection against the wind.

Rash vests are typically made from lycra because it’s stretchy and wears well in the water, but they can also be made from titanium, and other materials.

**Booties**<br>Surfers often wear booties to protect their feet when surfing over coral or rocky reefs. They’re made from neoprene and are usually no more than 2mm in thickness. Styles can vary with different toe styles and extra protection and flexibility where it is needed. There are different styles of booties for cold water conditions.

**Helmets**<br>Helmets can be worn in many different surf conditions and they are used to protect your head against injury from your own surfboard or other people’s surfboard.

When surfing over reef, helmets protect your head from damage cause by sharp coral or rocky reefs.

They’re made from hard, durable plastic and have added features including shatter proof visor, water proof lining and adjustable audio vents.

**Surf Caps**<br>Surf caps can be worn in the water when surfing and are designed to keep the sun off your face and protect you from sunburn. They also assist in keeping the sun’s glare out of your eyes. They are made from lightweight water resistant and flexible materials. Some have mesh on the sides of the hat to let water through.

﻿**Webbed Gloves**<br>Webbed gloves have a rubber web skin between each finger — the more surface area you have with your hands, the more water you can pull through and the faster you will paddle. They are made from light weight neoprene and designs can include full fingers or mitt gloves without the finger tips.
