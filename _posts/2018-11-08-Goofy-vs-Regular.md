# Goofy vs Regular

You’ve probably heard of the terms “goofy” and “regular” used in many different sports including skating, windsurfing, snowboarding, wake boarding, and of course, surfing. This terminology is related to your stance.

A “regular” stance is left foot forward, right foot back. This tends to be anyone with a dominant right foot.

A “goofy” stance is right foot forward, left foot back. A “goofy footer” is less common than someone with a regular stance, in the same way that less people are left handed.

How to find out what stance you are?
If you’ve played soccer before, whatever foot you usually kick with is generally your surfing stance. For example, if you kick the ball with your right foot, you’re probably a regular. But if you haven’t played a sport like this, grab a broom and start sweeping. Whichever way around you find yourself, this will tend to be your stance. Plus, it’ll tidy the house up too ;)

Left foot forward is regular, right foot forward is goofy.

Being goofy vs regular won’t affect anything to do with choosing your surfboard or how you surf!
